										<span class="heading-meta">About Me</span>
										<h2 class="colorlib-heading">Career Insight and Aspirations</h2>
										<p><strong> Hello! My name is Darren Hsing.</strong> An incoming college first-year with ambition and future aspirations. I have a strong appreciation for modern-day Finance & Tech and want to combine that passion with my zeal for problem solving and collaboration.</p>
                                        
										<p> Finance is the management, creation, and study of money and investments. Individuals, organizations, and governments face choices on how to acquire capital and how they will control their expenditures. Finances are commonly broken down into corporate finance, personal finance, and public finance.</p>

										<p> The fourth industrial revolution has increased society’s reliance on technology and the power of computation that drives us to achieve what seemed impossible. As technology and artificial intelligence takes over industries by automating mundane processes, having computer science and analytical skills as part of your repertoire becomes more and more valuable in addition to having strong business acumen. The market opportunity for computer science in all analysis career fields is limitless. As businesses and organizations grow with improved technology, they rely on the financial markets to hire, invest, and grow. The demand for job prospects in the financial markets has consistently increased.</p>

										<p> Technology provides the modern financial analyst with new tools to evolve their ability to analyze and predict with a wealth of data. Analysts today utilize machine learning and artificial intelligence in tandem with Excel and databases to maximize their analytical ability. Becoming a consultant focused in finance and tech combines both analysis and problem solving. Along with Finance and Tech, the modern consultant/analyst requires knowledge in statistics, mathematics, finance, and management.</p>

										<p>The <a href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/business-and-financial/financial-analysts.htm" target="_blank"> U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)</a> states that quantitative analysis is a field projected to grow by at least “16% between 2019 and 2029”. This number is faster than the job growth of all occupations. The BLS also states that the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/business-and-financial/management-analysts.htm" target="_blank"> investment analysis field (consulting)</a> is projected to grow by at least “11% between 2019 and 2029”. According to <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/professionals/081815/career-advice-management-consulting-vs-investment-banking.asp" target="_blank"> Investopedia</a>, an average starting consultant with a Bachelor’s Degree earns an average salary between $64,000 and $100,000 while an average starting consultant with a Master’s in Business Administration (MBA) can earn up to $200,000. This is far greater than the national median salary of $37,040. I hope to hold a career in this field and I plan to fully utilize my next four years of post-secondary education to enhance the skills required of this career while exploring unique opportunities to obtain hands-on experience.</p>

Stern School of Business </a>with the goal of learning more about the financial markets, accounting, marketing, and economics. Our Summer@Stern Class of 2019 was selected among hundreds of applicants to attend and this was my first college oriented experience. We received lectures and seminars from notable NYU Stern professors Dr. Dan Gode and Dr. Adam Alter. </br></br> We spoke to student panels of current students and graduates in the financial sector to discuss their paths for post-secondary education and their career ambitions. I was able to explore the beautiful city of New York City and simultaneously gained the skills necessary to advance my education in finance and business. Our professors led us through multiple astounding cases written from the Harvard Business School (HBS) and taught us personal finance lessons apart from our accounting and financial markets curriculum. </br></br>I learned the importance of independent exploration, teamwork, confidence, and perseverance. The value of attending NYU Stern influenced me to continue striving for excellence and further explore our ever changing world.</p> Learn more about <a href="https://www.stern.nyu.edu/programs-admissions/undergraduate/high-school-summer-program" target="_blank">Summer@Stern</a> and <a href="https://www.stern.nyu.edu/" target="_blank">NYU Leonard S.

As a <strong>Bronco</strong>, I will be pursuing a Bachelor’s of Science in Finance in the <a href="https://www.scu.edu/business/" target="_blank">Leavey School of Business</a> with a minor in Business Analytics. I will also potentially be studying Economics in the College of Arts and Sciences. </p> <p>I plan to fully utilize Santa Clara University’s resources through joining on campus organizations and professional fraternities, pursuing my own research, and working internships in the Greater San Francisco Bay Area. It is the home of many tech companies and financial services firms including Apple, Cisco, Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, KPMG, Deloitte, Accenture, PricewaterhouseCoopers, and McKinsey & Co. — all of which I dream of working at.</p>	<p>Learn more about <a href="https://www.scu.edu/business/" target="_blank">Santa Clara University Leavey School of Business</a> and <a href="https://damore-mckim.northeastern.edu/" target="_blank">Northeastern University D’Amore McKim School of Business</a>.</p>

As the Vice President of Outreach in the Bay Area, I served the most competitive and successful section in California consisting of 2000+ students across the Greater San Francisco Bay Area in 20+ local chapters. As part of the Executive Board, I managed communications, chapter resources, and training for the local chapters.

					                  <p>In the summer of 2019, I sought after new projects I can explore at my high school, Homestead High School. Using the tools and expertise I acquired through my other extracurricular endeavors, I banded with a group of students to create the Homestead Student Club Association. The core objective of the organization is to cultivate the intellectual diversity and curiosity at <a href="https://hhs.fuhsd.org/" target="_blank">Homestead High School</a> through the many student led organizations focusing on business, law, STEM, social activism, and culture. The purpose of the organization was to serve as a backbone of collaboration between clubs and organizations and as a consulting service for on-campus organizations. Unfortunately, due to COVID-19 the lifespan of the project was dramatically shortened before the founding members were to carry out their kick start event. The organization, however, still delivered a dramatic and lasting impact with the idea that not all campus organizations are on their own. HSCA has inspired collaboration, innovative thinking, and a strong sense of community even after my peers and I have graduated high school. The leadership, problem solving, and creative thinking skills I have acquired from this experience are crucial for taking on the role of a consultant.</p> <p>Learn more about <a href="https://hhs.fuhsd.org/student-life/student-activities/clubs" target="_blank">Clubs & Student Organizations</a> at Homestead High School.</p>

					                  <p>My first major role at my high school’s local Future Business Leaders of America chapter was the Vice President of Technology. The core purpose I served as the VP of Technology was to expand and maintain the <a href="http://hhsfbla.com/" target="_blank">website</a> and databases our organization owned and to manage our technology competitions branch. As the VP of Technology, I supervised competitions for 150+ student competitors, managed a mentor networking system, and secured professional contacts to support our students. In addition, I led multiple educational workshops on planning coding projects, public speaking, effective communication, and PowerPoint presentations. In that year, I also had general officer responsibilities where I helped my chapter develop strategies for member retention and acquisition and register over 150 members to become the largest chapter in the Western Region. With a total of 13 teams I managed, a majority of teams, competing in different events, earned top 10 recognition at the State Leadership Conference and over half of teams are nationally ranked in the top 10. My efforts in leading my teams helped Homestead FBLA secure our 20th consecutive national championship.</p> <p>Learn more about <a href="https://www.fbla-pbl.org/fbla/competitive-events/" target="_blank">FBLA Competitive Events</a> and <a href="http://hhsfbla.com/" target="_blank">Homestead High School Future Business Leaders of America (HHSFBLA)</a></p>

As an active volunteer in CSF I volunteered in local Parent Teacher Associations (PTA), education nights at local elementary schools, and organizations for survivors of sexual violence. In addition to volunteering in CSF, I also volunteered in academic tutoring. As a part of the <a href="https://hhs.fuhsd.org/academics/departments/avid" target="_blank">Advancement Via Individual Determination (AVID) Program</a>, aimed to provide students support to thrive through practicing academic skill, I tutored students in Pre-Algebra, Algebra I, Algebra II, and Trigonometry. Finally, as part of the Homestead High School <a href="https://hhs.fuhsd.org/academics/library" target="_blank">Academic Foundation</a> I worked in the campus library to tutor over 50+ students in Chemistry, Algebra II, Trigonometry, Geometry, Spanish, Programming, International Business, and Law. My volunteering experiences have influenced me to take in strong interest in social justice and social activism. I also learned many invaluable interpersonal skills that will be advantageous in the professional workplace. </p>

										<h3>Public Speaking</h3>
										<span>After joining FBLA in my freshman year, I developed my public speaking to what it is today. I decided to assert myself where I was most uncomfortable with to engage my public speaking ability. My Case Study team and I were able to work our way to rank as <strong>State Champions and 5th Nationally</strong>. Preparing a case study within minutes and communicating the case study framework with my teammates drove me to hone my critical thinking skills. I learned to be <strong>confident and assertive</strong> when effectively communicating solutions.</span>

										<h3>Entrepreneurial Mindset</h3>
										<span>At the end of my junior year in May of 2019, I began asking myself how can I as an individual innovate my community of peers and staff at Homestead High School. In June 2019, I founded the <strong>Homestead Student Club Association (HSCA)</strong> as a way to connect and innovate the club and student organization landscape. We were able to leave a lasting impact and to inspire our peers to continue to innovate and bring positivity to the communities dear to their heart.</span>

In summer of 2020, I reached out to my community college to kickstart my learning in business and economics. By completing both <strong>Macroeconomics and Microeconomics</strong> without any previous economics background was fulfilling and extremely eye opening. Beyond economics, I began taking online courses for <strong>Python, HTML, and CSS</strong>. I look forward to spending the time I have before college starts to explore my interests more.</span>
